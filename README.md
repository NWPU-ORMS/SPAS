# Data for the stochastic patient admission scheduling problem

This is a repository for the data used in the paper: ```Stochastic patient admission scheduling problem with an exponential number of scenarios```. 

Our instance generation program is based on the program of [Ceschia and Schaerf (2012)], which is available at https://bitbucket.org/satt/PASU/. The original program generates instances with a fixed overstay length for each patient. We modified the program to give a number of scenarios for each patient, where each scenario represents a possible realization of the overstay length for each patient.
